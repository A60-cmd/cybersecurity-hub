    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Social engineering manipulates human psychology to trick individuals into revealing confidential information or performing unsafe actions. 
      It exploits trust rather than technical flaws.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pretexting (posing as authority to extract info).</li>
      <li>Baiting (luring with free USBs or downloads).</li>
      <li>Tailgating (following someone into restricted areas).</li>
      <li>Phishing (digital form of social engineering).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
    <p>
      In 2011, RSA suffered a breach after employees were tricked into opening a phishing email, leading to stolen data critical for SecureID tokens.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct security awareness training.</li>
      <li>Verify identities before sharing sensitive data.</li>
      <li>Use multi-factor authentication to reduce risks.</li>
    </ul>
